Since 2008 I've worked for Door4 (link), a Digital Agency based in Burnley and Manchester. During this time I've created digital products and services for the UK Government, Local Councils, National Public information programmes, Childrens Services, National Charities, Large Ecommerce businesses and hundreds of SMEs. 

I've collaborated, advised and designed products with partner digital and service agencies such as Refinery, Ampersand and Rainmaker. 

I've managed teams of designers, developers and collaborated with project managers, service designers, sales teams and marketeers, directors and senior stakeholders.

Prior to my current role I worked in the print industry as a Graphic Designer and Reprographic Technician for Bank of Scotland, theAA, Sainsburys, Pizza Hut and Nisa. 

I'm now looking for new opportunities and to broaden my horizons. I'm a self learner and am always looking to push my boundaries to take myself out of my comfort zone.

## Away from work

Husband and Father of two, I like nothing better than spending time with my family. When not being the perfect role model husband and dad you'll find me cooking, gardening, swimming, watching gods own team or attempting to lower my handicap. I also have a strong sense of community bringing my skills and experience in digital to raise money for a local park fun day and helping to raise funds to send a local boy for a life improving operation.

It's been a while since I applied for a position and as such my portfolio is very much WIP.
