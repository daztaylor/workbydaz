I have over 25 years experience in graphic and digital design, spending the last 12 years as part of the Door4 team. Combining skills in interface design, user experience, creative reasoning and problem solving to deliver usable, attractive interfaces and design patterns.

Recent engagements include involvement in disruptive processes embedding in a number of Government departments, large scale E-commerce projects with Magento, engineering a Design Process and sites and products for small and medium sized enterprises.

I create clean, simple, usable digital products and services using common sense logic whilst questioning the latest industry gimmick or fad. I can code to a reasonable level I use this experience to help understand the engineering process which as a result, feeds into my design process. 

I always put the end user first and clearly communicate to other designers, engineers and senior stakeholders. I believe open thought and discussion and working-out-loud to get the best results.  I challenge preconceived ideas and am not afraid to be wrong to achieve the right solution.
