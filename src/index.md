I have over 25 years experience in graphic and digital design, spending the last 12 years as a key member of the Door4 team. I combine skills in interface design, user experience, creative reasoning and problem solving to deliver usable, attractive interfaces and design patterns.

Recent engagements include: involvement in agile, disruptive processes; secondments in a number of Government departments, working on large scale E-commerce projects; creating a Design Process to help and educate my teams; the workshop, wireframe and design of many sites and products for small and medium sized enterprises.

I create clean, simple, usable digital products and services using common sense logic whilst questioning the latest industry gimmick or fad. I can code to a reasonable level and I use these skills to help me understand the engineering process which, as a result, feeds into my design process. 

I always put the end user first and clearly communicate to other designers, engineers and senior stakeholders. I believe open-thought, discussion and working-out-loud to get the best results.  I challenge preconceived ideas and am not afraid to be wrong to achieve the right solution.
