I create clean, simple, usable digital products and services using common sense logic whilst questioning the latest industry gimmick or fad. I can code to a reasonable level and due to this I have an excellent understanding about the engineering process which feeds into my design process. 

I always put the end user first and clearly communicate to other designers, engineers and senior stakeholders. I believe open thought and discussion and working-out-loud to get the best results.  I challenge preconceived ideas and am not afraid to be wrong if it ultimately leads to the right solution and I keep my ego for the golf course.
