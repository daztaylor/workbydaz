#### The problem

Prior to November 2017 The DiT have thousands of civil servants around the with little direct communication due to outdated internal systems. At a very sensitive time due to Brexit the department were under pressure from Ministers to show future deals were possible and a new way of communicating was needed.

#### My role

I was sub-contracted in by our partner agency, Rainmaker.solutions to design a intranet and people finder product to support the 3000+ Civil Servants around the globe. Part of the 'High Performing Team', my role was to work with other UX service designers, policy makers and copywriters to deliver an effective and on brand user journey and interface.

My prior experience of designing and building Wordpress products helped me suggest and design familiar WP userflows, patterns and templates.

#### The outcome

Shortly after completion almost 3000 Civil Servants had signed up to the new intranet and completed their profile.

#### What I learnt

How to effectively plan, design and integrate with a large scale Design System (GDS). First real exposure to a 'true' Agile workflow, including daily standups, stories, sprints, user testing, feedback and show and tell. Also the first time I'd experienced Ruby and Headless development processes.
