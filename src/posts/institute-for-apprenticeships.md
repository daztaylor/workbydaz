Two month subcontract remotely working over video conference loosely based on Google Design Sprint. Taking a very basic, single page user requirement brief to produce clickable prototype which informed the technical specification and future UX and UI work.

Worked with the Service Design team in phase 2 fleshing out personas, user flows and storyboards with clickable prototypes to present back to the board. 

* UX Solution design with service designer
* Pitch visuals to win project
* High definition prototypes built to test with InVision
