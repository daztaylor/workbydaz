Researched and ran an internal workshop for a new product to be launched in Magnet Trade stores and online. Working with product owners and marketing team I ran the workshop to storyboard an online form which leveraged existing catalogue data and allowed kitchen designers to validate requirements before contacting customers with an accurate quotation. 

From there I created high fidelity, on brand designs and built a clickable prototype to demonstrate to the client before generating and handing off assets and briefing the development team. 

The project was built on time to a demanding schedule.
