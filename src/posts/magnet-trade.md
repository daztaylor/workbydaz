Researched and ran an internal workshop for a new product to be launched in Magnet Trade stores and online. Working with product owners and marketing team I ran the workshop to storyboard an online form which leveraged existing catalogue data and allowed kitchen designers to validate requirements before contacting customers with an accurate quotation. From there I built out a clickable prototype to demonstrate to the client before handing over assets and briefing the development team. Project built on time to a demanding schedule.



_'Ian – he really likes it!_’\
Ian is the marketing director for the whole of Magnet. Praise really doesn’t come lightly from Ian, so this is a big deal. Daz does it again :)
